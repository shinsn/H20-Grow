This is a python application created as the final project for the class, Fundamentals in Software Design.
This application utilizes Python libraries to create a interactive water tracker that aims to encourage healthy habits!
H2O Grow allows users to log their daily water intake, view past entries and track progress charts for daily, weekly and monthly goals.
There are also features for unit conversions and personalized intake targets as we wanted this application to be personalized for each user.
